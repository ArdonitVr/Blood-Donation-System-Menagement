# Blood-Donation-System-Menagement
All of the blood that is received or donated in a Blood Donation Event or Hospital, must be managed thoroughly and systematacially. The development of this project will offer and allow us to manage all of the donators, their blood groups and other details. The system contains two Modules : Administrators and Users. The Admin Module has four Menus: Home - which contains functions, such as managing Blood Groups and their Donator, add, update and delete. Contacts Menu - allows us to manage the feedback of the donators. Users Menu - here we can add a new user, modify it and delete them. Log out Menu - Logs the user out and brings us to the login page. The User Module contains in itself two Menus: Home and Contact. The Home Menu displays the Blood Donators and all of their details: name, surname, age, address and blood type or group. The Contact Menu can be used as a feedback tool or plainly for sending a message to the administrator. The header contains the title of the web application, the abbreviation, the menus. While Footer contained a description or a motive message, Address, Social Networking, and credits directed to html5up.net for the template.
